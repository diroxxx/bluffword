# Bluffword - In progress

**Bluffword** is a real-time multiplayer party game of words, bluffing, and deduction. In each round, all players receive a secret word — except one. That one player, the impostor, must fake it without being caught!

## Game Overview

Bluffword is a game for 3+ players where the goal is to figure out who among you is pretending to know the word.

### How It Works:
- Players join a room using a code.
- A secret word is given to all players **except one impostor**.
- Everyone writes a one-word clue related to the secret word.
- After reading all clues, players vote on who they believe the impostor is.
- If the impostor is eliminated, the others win — if not, the game continues.
